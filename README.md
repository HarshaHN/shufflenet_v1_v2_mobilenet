Date: Nov-Dec 2018 | Author: Harsha HN harshahn@kth.se | 

ShuffleNet is an efficient Convolutional Neural Network for Mobile devices by reducing the computational burden for a comparable accuracy with other popular Deep Convolutional Neural Networks such as MobileNet, ResNet, GoogleNet. It consists of group convolutions and depth-wise separable convolutions.

Part of the course 'Deep Learning in Data Science' presented at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.
